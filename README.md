📊 Retail Sales Dashboard Summary

The retail sales dashboard provides a comprehensive view of customer behavior, sales trends, and product performance across the year. Key insights from the exploratory data analysis are summarized below.

1. Sales Trends Over Time

Daily sales show significant fluctuation throughout the year, with several sharp peaks. These spikes likely correspond to promotional events, holidays, or seasonal shopping periods. Consistent underlying sales indicate steady customer demand, but opportunities exist to optimize performance during low-activity days.

2. Sales by Age Group

The age groups 21–30, 31–40, and 41–50 generate the highest total sales, making them the core customer segments. The 18–20 and 60+ groups show considerably lower spending, suggesting opportunities to improve outreach or tailor offerings to these under-engaged demographics.

3. Sales by Product Category

Electronics is the top-performing category, followed closely by Clothing, while Beauty products trail behind. This indicates strong customer interest in higher-value or essential items, with potential to grow Beauty sales through marketing, bundling, or promotional strategies.

4. Sales by Gender

Sales are fairly balanced between male and female customers, with females slightly ahead. This balanced distribution highlights the importance of maintaining inclusive marketing strategies while still using category-specific targeting to boost performance for each group.

🎯 Overall Insights

Electronics and Clothing drive the majority of revenue.

Customers between 21 and 50 represent the most valuable demographic.
